            <h1>Hello! I{`'`}m Cristian Laynez</h1>
            <br></br>
            <p>I learned to program when I was 15 years old, my first language was C#</p>
            <p>
              Since that day I tried to start learning on my own, I consider myself a self-taught
              person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to university education I have been able to learn more about programming and
              other skills
            </p>
            <p>
              such as application design, mathematics, and I have competed in a few hackathons and
              competitions.

            <h1>Adventist School JUBA - [2016 - 2019]</h1>
            <p>From 2016 to 2017 I attended 8th and 9th grade.</p>
            <p>From 2018 to 2019 I studied a Computer Science Baccalaureate.</p>
            <p>
              During that time I took the opportunity to learn several things about programming as
              well as 3D Art and video game development.

            <br />
            <p>
              I will never forget that first day at University, my chances of getting in were very
              low despite having passed the admission exam and being granted a scholarship
              percentage.
            </p>
            <p>
              But thanks to my persistence and my family who supported and believed in me, I managed
              to enter the University and the career of my dreams.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To this day I have not forgotten my ideals, goals, and dreams, I remain faithful to my
              dreams and aspirations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>When I hold on to something I really want/desire, I don{`'`}t let go easily.</p>
